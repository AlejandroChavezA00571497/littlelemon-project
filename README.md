Hey there! 
Thanks for checking out this project. It's based on the Little Lemon restaurant project of the past course, but altering the functionality to integrate authentication, as well as API functionality around the bookings system, and a couple of tests around adding Menu items through the API. That last part is not working as well as I'd like it, but I felt like playing with the idea.

The endpoints that you could test through requests in Insomnia are:
api/bookings/
api/menu/
api/token/
api/token/refresh/

Have fun testing it out!
